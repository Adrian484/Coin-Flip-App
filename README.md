COIN FLIP APP

After completing my course I decided to create a basic app to simulate a coin flip as part of retaining my coding knowledge but also to have a bit of fun as well.

Utilising index.html, style.css and main.js, I created a box with two sides, which I will call faces. Those faces were called "Heads" and "Tails"

I implented math.random() to make it randomly choose a particular side and then it would turn to whichever side it rolled to. The default showing side was heads and if it 
rolled onto the same side it was already on, it would stay there and not move any further. It used different coloured boxes to help distinguish the sides.

After a lot of back and forth, after I got the desired functionality of it always flipping upon a click and only stopping on the side that is randomly selected in the code, 
I decided to turn these boxes into actual coin faces. I found an image of each side on Google Images of an Australian $1 coin and spent well over an hour trying
to crop the background out in Paint and Paint3D before I found the first free background remover tool online that immediately did a better job.

There was a lot of cobwebs to burn in this project and I had a surprising amount of issues just to get the animation and code to not only work the correct way, but to work
the correct way at the right time and after completing the animation, don't revert back to the first frame of the animation which was the default heads side. 

I have messages that display depending on the face shown and if the coin is flipping prior to the animations being added so I know the code was working and not to spam click
or be impatient.
